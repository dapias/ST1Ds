# Numerical tests for ergodicity of Singly 1D Thermostatted Systems (ST1Ds) 

We provide the code that supports the numerical tests reported in the manuscript [Ergodicity of one--dimensional systems coupled to the logistic thermostat](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05090).

This is a Julia package for performing simulations in the canonical ensemble for one--dimensional systems within the formalism of Density Dynamics. 

Its use is illustrated in the notebook `Running simulations.ipynb` provided in the folder `Examples`.

## Installation

From within Julia do

```
julia> Pkg.clone("git://github.com/dapias/ThermostattedDynamics.jl.git")
```

## Requirements

- [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Usage

There is a jupyter notebook in the folder `Examples` called `Running Simulations.ipynb` where the usage of the main functions is illustrated.
